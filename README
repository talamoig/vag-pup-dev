This is a tool to have a simple Vagrant-based environment to do puppet modules development.

All machine have the puppet dir available on /vagrant/puppet.

You can:
1. ssh to a machine and run manually 
sudo puppet apply --pluginsync --verbose --modulepath /vagrant/puppet/modules/ /vagrant/puppet/manifests/site.pp

or do it with pprun.sh that accepts the hostname as parameter

2. run ppck.sh
That has a list of host (variable PUPPET_CLIENTS) and on all of them does:
 - vagrant destroy
 - vagrant up
 - run puppet apply as in 1

This is useful for perfoming tests from scratch.


A tipical workflow is:
- on the git repo of your puppet module create a branch for your feature (git checkout -b newfeature)
- test it with ppck.sh until it works
- test it the ppck.sh until it works
- commit the changes on the puppet module repo
- merge the branch to the master (git checkout master; git merge newfeature; git branch -d newfeature)
- modify the metadata.json to release a new version (git tag v0.0.x; git push --all; git push --tags)
- run 'puppet module build' to build a new tgz to upload on puppetforge
